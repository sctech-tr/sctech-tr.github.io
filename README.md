# welcome to my dumb wedsite!
you will find things here.
## how to add your own personal page:
1. fork this repo.
2. add your page to /users
3. open a pr here.
4. github actions will automatically merge it if these conditions are met:
- you only uploaded one html page (you can put the css and js code inside the file)
- the username isn't taken
- it is an html file
## if you don't have a github account and/or you don't know how to open a pr:
learn how to open a pr **or** send me a mail: gq2ic3wbe@mozmail.com (maximum mail size is 10 mb)
## rules:
- no nsfw
- no malware
- no racism
- no promoting a country
- no begging for followers/stars in any kind of platform

if you do at least one of these:

- i will remove your page and replace it with a "this person is banned because of their actions." page
- i will report you to github
- i will prevent you from adding any pages in the future

have fun!
